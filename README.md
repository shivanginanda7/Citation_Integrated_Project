# Citation_Integrated_Project
Researchers are expected to find previous literature that is related to their research and potentially has a scientific impact from among a large number of publications. The bibliometric criterion for judging the impact of biomedical papers and their authors’ work is the number of citations received which is commonly referred to as “citation count”. This metric however is unavailable until several years after publication time. Many studies have shown that early citations contribute to improving the performance of predicting the long-term impact of a paper. We use deep learning techniques to encode the text, and to predict the impact of the citation used for individual articles using Title of the article, Publication year and Name of senior author.
